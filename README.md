NHS COI
=======

Presenting structured and raw data we received in response to
requesting Conflict of Interest registers from evey Trust in England.

To install, make a file at `./conf/general.yml` using the example in that folder, then run:

    ./script/post-deploy

Then set up a web server with its document root pointing to `./_site/`
(see the contents of the `deploy/` directory for example nginx config)

These steps are carried out for you if you run

    fab deploy:production

or

    fab deploy:staging


# Implementation notes

The script `generate_data.py` does the following:

* [NHS Trusts](https://nhsenglandfilestore.s3.amazonaws.com/ods/etr.csv). This file propercased, headers added, turned into `trusts.csv`
* [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XYZZsRq50WsVjJfuCWNbEughXQqyiFJeW7tXGgdBv5I/) originally created by Harriet. It contains 3 worksheets; we're interested in two:
  * The "Responses" worksheet contains questions and answers for individual Trusts (e.g. did they respond on time, etc). We convert this to a CSV `hospitality-coi-raw.csv`. The data from this CSV is displayed on the page for an individual trust. It also contains a column with a reference to a DOI from Figshare, with which we can refer to the document(s) returned by Trusts in response to the FOI requests.
  * The "Transparency Score" worksheet is a hand-normalised version of a subset of the same data, with a Total Score column.  We add a ranking column, and convert this to `hospitality-coi-scores.csv`. This data is displayed on the home page.

The two worksheets are joined by the "org code" column which must be consistent between them and the `trusts.csv` file.

Jekyll generates static pages by running the plugin code at
`_plugins/trusts.rb`, which iterates over the contents of the three
CSVs described above.
