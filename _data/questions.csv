registration,registration_1,Do they have a policy to register all trials (excepting specific exclusions in later columns) from now?
registration,registration_2,"Do they say they conduct any kind of audit of compliance with their registration policy? (If they don't mention it, then no.)"
registration,registration_3,"If they do conduct an audit of compliance, do they share the summary results of this audit publicly?"
registration,registration_4,"If they do conduct an audit of compliance, do they share the line by line individual trial data from this audit publicly? (That is: the names of trials, and then whether they were in compliance with the policy, or not.)"
registration,registration_5,"Does the policy include phase 4 trials? If they say ""all"" then this is assumed to include phase 4."
registration,registration_6,Does their current policy describe the registration policy covering past trials?
registration,registration_7,"From what date does this policy apply? (Give explanation of how year is used eg ""trials initiated after 2001"" or ""trials used in regulatory approval since 2003"" etc, or if not other details given then ""200x NOS"" [not otherwise specified]).This date is normalised after the second ""/"" to permit comparisons between companies. The average duration of a clinical trial is 2 years, as per Pregelj 2015. Therefore we normalise to NOS date. If a company commitment is ""trials initiated after 2010"" then this becomes ""2011"", if the commitment is ""trials completing after 2012"" then this becomes ""2011"", and so on. Whole years are used for simplicity. "
results,results_1,Do they have a policy to make all summary results available? (Excepting specific exclusions in later columns).
results,results_2,"Do they commit to post summary results on pre-specified primary and secondary outcomes to clinicaltrials.gov within 12 months of completion? (Here, we are strict on 12 months, because without a time commitment there is effectively no commitment; where there is a longer time commitment, we give no and specify the delayed time period in a comment. If a company only says it commits to comply with legislation they get ""no"" here, as legislation does not cover all trials.)"
results,results_3,"Do they commit to post summary results to their own website within 12 months of completion? (Note same conditions on ""within 12 months"" apply as for posting results on clinicaltrials.gov)."
results,results_4,"Do they commit to submit all trial results to an academic journal within 12 months of completion. (This cannot be with caveats, eg ""we submit all medically important results"" scores ""no"")."
results,results_5,Does this commitment to post summary results include unlicensed treatments?
results,results_6,"Does this commitment to post summary results include unlicensed uses of licensed treatments? (In the absence of a clear commitment either way: if the company does not post summary results on unlicensed treatments, the answer on unlicensed uses of licensed treatments is assumed to also be ""no""; if the company has a clear theme of ""all"" trials throughout their policy, then the answer is assumed to be ""yes""). "
results,results_7,"Does this commitment to post summary results include phase 4 trials? (In the absence of a clear commitment either way, if there is a clear theme of ""all"" throughout the policy document, for example if they have made commitments to phase 2-4 trials for other aspects of their policy and there is no reason to believe that this issue would be an exception to that, then this is ""yes"").  "
results,results_8,"Does their current policy cover results of past trials, committing to make all results available (excepting specific exclusions in later columns)? If this commitment is only for a poorly defined subset of trials, such as ""medically important results"", this is coded as ""no""."
results,results_9,Do they commit to post summary results of all past trials (excepting specific exclusions in later columns) on pre-specified primary and secondary outcomes to clinicaltrials.gov? (Note this does not require a 12 month criteria for posting results).
results,results_10,"Do they commit to post summary results of all past trials (excepting specific exclusions in later columns) to their own website? (Again, the retrospective commitment does not include a ""within 12 months"" requirement)."
results,results_11,"Do they commit to submit all trials to an academic journal. (Note this must be all trials, not ""all interesting trials"" etc)."
results,results_12,Does this commitment to posting summary results of past trials include trials on unlicensed treatments?
results,results_13,"Does this commitment to posting summary results of past trials results include unlicensed uses of licensed treatments? (In the absence of a clear commitment either way: if the company does not post summary results on unlicensed treatments, the answer on unlicensed uses of licensed treatments is assumed to also be ""no""; if the company has a clear theme of ""all"" trials throughout their policy, then the answer is assumed to be ""yes""). "
results,results_14,"Does this commitment to post summary results of past trials include phase 4 trials? (In the absence of a clear commitment either way, if there is a clear theme of ""all"" throughout the policy document, for example if they have made commitments to phase 2-4 trials for other aspects of their policy and there is no reason to believe that this issue would be an exception to that, then this is ""yes"").  "
results,results_15,"From what date does this policy on posting summary results for all trials apply? (Give explanation of how year is used eg ""trials initiated after 2001"" or ""trials used in regulatory approval since 2003"" etc, or if not other details given then ""200x NOS"" [not otherwise specified]).This date is normalised after the second ""/"" to permit comparisons between companies. The average duration of a clinical trial is 2 years, as per Pregelj 2015. Therefore we normalise to NOS date. If a company commitment is ""trials initiated after 2010"" then this becomes ""2011"", if the commitment is ""trials completing after 2012"" then this becomes ""2011"", and so on. Whole years are used for simplicity. For ""drugs approved after year x"" an additional year is added. So ""approved after 2013"" would normalise to ""2011"". There is no perfect method to make dates comparable between companies. "
csrs,csrs_1,Do they have a policy on sharing Clinical Study Reports (CSRs) at all?
csrs,csrs_2,Do they commit to share CSRs?
csrs,csrs_3,"Is access to CSRs on request only, rather than prospectively posting CSRs online? (If only on request, summarise in comment how onerous the request process is, e.g. is it the same high level of workload as for a full IPD request, with extensive review of request and requesters; or is this just being used to prioritise which CSRs to share by the company?)"

"
csrs,csrs_7,"Does the policy commit to sharing synopses only? (This means: are synopses the only part of the CSR ever made available? If actual CSRs are available on request, and the synopses are routinely published, then this field is coded ""no"", and the CSR sharing policy is coded as for their policy on sharing CSRs proper)."
